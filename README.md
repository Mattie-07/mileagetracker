# leasemiles

This is a Flutter Project designed to keep track of all the miles driven on my leased vehicle.
The project has a couple of goals that it aims to accomplish
Have a calendar to set the amount of miles driven in a given day/week
Tracking this information over time to ensure it is persistent.
Have a designated portion/area that shows the limit of miles I have for that day.
